Basic Font Information
--------------------------

Slinkee is a playful and bouncy typeface designed by [Kimchi Lee](http://kimchilee.me/) The typeface was made during an exploration of a completely different idea. Its design is meant to evoke the movement of the childhood favourite slinky toy, as it stretches out and closes back in.
